# Nest.js and SQL Server System

## Overview

This system is developed using [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), a powerful and extensible Node.js framework for building server-side applications, and [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server), a relational database management system by Microsoft.

## Components

### 1. Nest.js Application

The backend of the system is built with Nest.js, which follows the modular architecture pattern. Key components include:

- **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests and define API endpoints.
- **Services:** Implement business logic and interact with the database.
- **Modules:** Organize and encapsulate related functionality.

### 2. SQL Server Database

The system uses SQL Server as the relational database for storing and managing data. Key aspects include:

- **Tables:** Defined to represent entities and relationships in the system.
- **Stored Procedures:** For complex database operations and business logic.
- **Indexes and Constraints:** Optimizing data retrieval and ensuring data integrity.

## Functionality

The Nest.js application interacts with the SQL Server database to provide various functionalities, including:

- **User Authentication:** Implementing secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Data CRUD Operations:** Enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of data.
- **Business Logic:** Executing specific business rules and operations.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker for SQL Server containerization
- Nest CLI for Nest.js development

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KevinMRmz/inventory-backend.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-project`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the Nest.js application: `npm run start:dev`

## Deployment

For deployment, consider containerizing the Nest.js application and SQL Server using Docker. Docker Compose can be used to define and orchestrate the deployment environment.

## Conclusion

This system showcases the integration of Nest.js and SQL Server to build a robust and scalable backend for various applications. The modular structure of Nest.js allows for maintainability and extensibility, while SQL Server provides a reliable and efficient database solution.
